## TODO List

  * First I will generate samples from Poisson distribution. I will take a sample from Poisson distributions of two different rates and conduct a test of hypothesis on the two samples. Do this for 1000 simulated pairs of samples.
  
  * I will record in a data frame if I reject the hypothesis that the two samples come from the same distribution or not.
  
  * Take the average of the logical vector (column) of TRUE and FALSE values to obtain the rejection rate of the test.
  
  * Do this using different shifted symmetric distributions. About 1000 different shifted pairs of distributions.
  
  * Plot the powers obtained from all these tests.
  
  * Take 1000 pairs of samples from the same distribution(not shifted).
  
  * Conduct a wilcoxon Rank sum test on these 1000 pairs of samples and record in the dataframe whether the tests rejects the null hypothesis or not( TRUE or FALSE)
  
  * Do this for skewed distribution.
  
  * Make plots of the powers.
  
  * Make a report of findings and design a presentation.
