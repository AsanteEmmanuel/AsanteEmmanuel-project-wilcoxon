# project summary

The goal of project is to implement and investigate the behaviour of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test statistic on pairs of sample drawn from the same population as against pairs of samples drawn from  different population distributions. The project is aimed to study the variation of this test statistic with the two cases and to examine the strength of the test as a dependant on the underlying sample.

I will also examine the behaviour of the test statistic if the two samples are from a symmetric distribution or not.
