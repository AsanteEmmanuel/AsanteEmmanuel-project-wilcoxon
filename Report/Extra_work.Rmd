## Attempted Extra Work
 * Tried to coerce all wilcox_one_table function to take all possible probability distributions in R but failed.
 * I tried to simulate symmetric Beta samples for the test but failed to match `map()` function to the input parameters of `rbeta()`
 * Used `bench::mark()` on my functions but the code kept running until I restarted the r-session
 * Used the console to manualLY identify the relationship between poisson lambda and exponential rate in order to ensure that the assumption of equal variance was satisfied.
